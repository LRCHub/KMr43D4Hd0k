Wheezy outta here
Wheezy outta here, haha
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

Ayy, buss down on these hoes, let em' know, S.O.S
Hunnid' thousand dollar round my neck, make her undress
Know some niggas take ya' soul for a lil' cheque
Slide on them in the space coupe, no Star Trek

I made it out the jungle with finesse
Streets so weak, It got them young niggas possessed
Outside all night, don't wanna go home
Hopped out that paddy wagon, went straight to the payphone
Call my mom for metro, 15 years old
Yeah, 2016 I was so low
They tryna' send me back on 'role, will I make it home?
The shit I think about at night, only got [?]
Who was I before the fame, pussy ass niggas tellin' names
Aye, fuck ass nigga you to blame
Streets made me who I am, who I became
She wanna kick it with a star, we can go to Mars
I just popped these percs, don't pop no bars, say oh my god
Don't mean to be rude, don't mean to bombard
I smashed your hoe, I'm fuckin' your broad
She throwin' that neck, I'm makin' her nod
She know I be in love with no thot

Buss down on these hoes, let em' know, S.O.S
Hunnid' thousand dollar round my neck, make her undress
Know some niggas take ya' soul for a lil' cheque
Slide on them in the space coupe, no Star Trek
