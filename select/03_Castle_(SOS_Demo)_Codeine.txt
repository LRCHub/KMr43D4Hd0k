There's a castle in her heart
The walls go up for miles

There's a tower
You can see everything
But she shows you nothing
You can see everything
See up to heaven
And there's a couch
But the TV's somehow wrong
Nothing seems to fit
Everything that's good is hid

She's the king in Wittgenstein's world
She's the king in Wittgenstein's world

There's a castle
In her heart
Where she keeps everything...
Apart
The walls go up for miles
The walls go up for miles
