Earth mother in turmoil
Your burning core
Your voice calling from inside
For my love
Oceans of sorrow
Your broken waves
Your soil poisoned and stained
For my love
Endangered life runs out of air
No shell blue and dark at night
For my love
Your grounds divide us apart
And life tumbles deep
Into your heart
In dreams you believe
I can save your planet

Earth mother in turmoil
Your frozen land
Your sky shallow and divine
For my love
Your grounds divide us apart
And life tumbles deep
Into your heart
In dreams you believe
I can save your planet
Life turns around
And time heals your soul
In dreams you call SOS planet
