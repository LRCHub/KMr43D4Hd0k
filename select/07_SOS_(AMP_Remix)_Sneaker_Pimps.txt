Should have done it sooner but I didn't because
I don't even know myself
Everything I'm based on is just something I was
And I can't even sell myself

Oh mirror mirror hanging on the wall
Show me how to love myself
Should have done it sooner but I didn't because
I don't even trust myself

This is my SOS
These are the bridges I'm burning
I never needed such help
This is my SOS

I look much smaller seen from inside out
Far too small to see myself
Down on reflection
Cast in hate and in doubt
Flawed and flaws I add myself

Oh mirror mirror hanging on the wall
Please just show me someone else
My hopes were low and I got so much so less
Nothing left to save myself

This is my SOS
These are the bridges I'm burning
I never needed such help
This is my SOS

Each day a broken clock is true at least twice
Twice the odds I give myself
I know it would be kinda easy sometimes
If I felt like someone else

This is my SOS
These are the bridges I'm burning
I never needed such help
This is my SOS
I gave my level best
These hands are drowning, not waving
This is my SOS
This is your heart and I'm breaking
